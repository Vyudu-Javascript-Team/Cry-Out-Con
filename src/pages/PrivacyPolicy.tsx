            <p className="mb-4">
              The first time that a user provides an e-mail address in connection with his/her activities at the Site, we assign an identification 
              number to that e-mail address and deploy a cookie to the applicable user's PC. Whenever that user comes back to the Site using the 
              same PC, the cookie allows the Site to identify the user and to recall the user's e-mail address.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If, at any time, a user provides other information in connection with his/her activities on the Site (such as name, address, birth date, 
              gender, etc.), we may store that information, along with the user's e-mail address, in our user database. We may use the information 
              stored in our database:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
              <li>to effectuate the purpose or transaction for which the information was originally provided by a user</li>
              <li>to pre-populate information fields in the event that user wishes to purchase products and/or services or sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or other offers in the future</li>
              <li>to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while visiting the Site</li>
              <li>to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers, promotions, or advertisements that were historically, or are likely to be, of interest to that user</li>

            <p className="mb-4">
              An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors 
              who view certain advertisements or other information on the Site. Action tags are 1Ã—1 pixel images embedded in a website page that 
              are used to transparently collect information.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of the Site 
              and to provide information about what products/services are viewed or purchased.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to retain this cookie and action tag data indefinitely. At no time will we share cookie-related, 
              action-tag-related and/or generated information and/or data with third parties.
